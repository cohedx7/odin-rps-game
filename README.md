Rock Paper Scissors Project

22/03/2022:

Well, I had to look at a youtube tutorial by Ania Kub√≥w (3 ways to code Rock Paper Scissors in JavaScript) in order to figure out how to implement the UI in this RPS project-game...

Overall, I'm not completely pleased/satisfied by the end result, even though it works.

Not sure if I'll leave it like this or update it...

Well, I added some font colors and re-organized the text alignments with CSS, so it looks a little better now... I guess it's ok.
